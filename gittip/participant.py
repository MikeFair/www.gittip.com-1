        This method associates an account on another platform (GitHub, Twitter,
        DevNet, etc.) with the Gittip participant represented by self. Every 
        account elsewhere has an associated Gittip participant account, even if 
        its only a stub participant (it allows us to track pledges to that account
        should they ever decide to join Gittip).

        In certain circumstances, we want to present the user with a
        confirmation before proceeding to reconnect the account elsewhere to
        the new Gittip account; NeedConfirmation is the signal to request
        confirmation. If it was the last account elsewhere connected to the old
        Gittip account, then we absorb the old Gittip account into the new one,
        effectively archiving the old account.

        Here's what absorbing means:

            - consolidated tips to and fro are set up for the new participant

                Amounts are summed, so if alice tips bob $1 and carl $1, and
                then bob absorbs carl, then alice tips bob $2(!) and carl $0.

                And if bob tips alice $1 and carl tips alice $1, and then bob
                absorbs carl, then bob tips alice $2(!) and carl tips alice $0.

                The ctime of each new consolidated tip is the older of the two
                tips that are being consolidated.

                If alice tips bob $1, and alice absorbs bob, then alice tips
                bob $0.

                If alice tips bob $1, and bob absorbs alice, then alice tips
                bob $0.

            - all tips to and from the other participant are set to zero
            - the absorbed participant_id is released for reuse
            - the absorption is recorded in an absorptions table
